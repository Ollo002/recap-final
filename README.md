# recap-final
Final Project for graduate-level course BIOS 470 at Rice University. A recapitulation of some claims made in the paper "Characterizing the tumor microenvironment of metastatic ovarian cancer by single-cell transcriptomics" by Olalekan et al. 2021. I am currently adding to and improving this project.
